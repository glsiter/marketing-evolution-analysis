# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a digit marking project that appears to be in its initial stages. The repository currently contains:

- `index.html` - Empty HTML file (likely the main application entry point)
- `须知.md` - Empty markdown file (likely for project notes or instructions in Chinese)

## Architecture

This project appears to be starting as a web-based application, given the presence of an `index.html` file. The project name suggests it's related to digit marking functionality, potentially for image annotation or digit recognition tasks.

## Development Status

The project is currently in an initial/empty state with placeholder files. Future development should establish:

1. The specific purpose and scope of the digit marking functionality
2. Technology stack selection (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, framework choice, etc.)
3. Project structure and organization
4. Build and development tooling

## Notes

- The project name "digit-marking" suggests functionality related to marking or annotating digits
- The presence of Chinese documentation (`须知.md`) indicates potential multilingual support needs
- No build tools, dependencies, or development setup currently configured
